    <h2>Scientific Method</h2>
    <p>
      scientific method, mathematical and experimental technique employed in the
      sciences. More specifically, it is the technique used in the construction
      and testing of a scientific hypothesis. The process of observing, asking
      questions, and seeking answers through tests and experiments is not unique
      to any one field of science. In fact, the scientific method is applied
      broadly in science, across many different fields. Many empirical sciences,
      especially the social sciences, use mathematical tools borrowed from
      probability theory and statistics, together with outgrowths of these, such
      as decision theory, game theory, utility theory, and operations research.
      Philosophers of science have addressed general methodological problems,
      such as the nature of scientific explanation and the justification of
      induction..
