    <h2>Scientific Method</h2>
    <p>The scientific method is an empirical method for acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of
        science since at least the 17th century. It involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about
        what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation. It involves
        formulating hypotheses, via induction, based on such observations; the testability of hypotheses, experimental
        and the measurement-based statistical testing of deductions drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or
        elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings. These are principles of the scientific
        method, as distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.</p>
