                <p>Did you know Area 51 is one of the most documented 'military' installations on the planet. 
                <br>The US government has acknowledged its existence, and the CIA has even published documents about it.
                <br>But the US government has never acknowledged the existence of aliens, or UFOs, or alien autopsies, or alien technology, or alien spacecraft, or alien anything.
                <br>So why would the US government acknowledge the existence of Area 51, but not aliens?
